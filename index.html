          For the introduction of the class, we look at the beautiful start of
          what would lead to the modern computing that we see today. It also
          demonstrates the many functions that we utilize in our workflow in our
          time. It was suprising to see how much old technology was capable of
          back then, I thought there wasn't much to them. Of course, even with
          such impressive capabilities that were possible back at its
          conception, there were few glaring issues. While yes it was indeed an
          impressive technological feat accomplished, not everyone would have
          access to these computer systems. Since they would be very expensive,
          and these were MASSIVE machines, I'm guess people would have access to
          them by different means, like a company owned one. While these were
          issues with computers back then, we've learned to innovate, and
          upgrade our new computer technology to be more flexible and efficient.
          To conclude, computional advancements were quite revolutionary, and we
          have mostly improved them.

          This week's text tells us about the conception of the
          <b>Internet</b>, or
          <b>ARPANET</b>
          I should say. It was both a invention of the military and of
          researchers, but closely related to the military. A helpful thing that
          the <b>ARPANET</b> allowed was the communication, so militaries could
          communicate between each other safely, or better, "efficiently" (Roy,
          4). Various researchers and computer scientists from all around the
          world have divergent opinions on the relation on the intention for
          military use (Roy, 5). The <b>Cold War</b> was the event that sparked
          an "accelerated growth in the development of computer technologies",
          also a lot of funding was usually put into such projects (Roy, 9). As
          time passes, there are more people that become introduced the subject,
          like <b>Bill Gates</b>. He's the creator of Microsoft/Windows, he
          wanted that people "should need to pay for software" (Roy, 20). This
          started a big change for the Internet, and a lot of companies to jump
          onto the Internet bandwagon "towards oligapoly" (Roy, 22). To
          conclude, the text has taught a history of the Internet and some of
          the superpowers around it.

          Machines have been becoming our personlized assistant as we advanced
          through the 20th century. They've went from "room-sized structures" to
          small boxes and handhelds, from complex setting-up to simple
          efficient. In a time where solutions to world problems, computers
          could possibly come up a viable answer to that problem. The evolution
          of computer systems also complement the one of us humans. Although,
          again, a decent chunk of this evolution of technologies had been a
          result of research for the military. Programming has been becoming
          easier to write, and better access to it like books,etc. (example: "<i
            >The Catalog</i
          >"). To conclude, this text has shown me a bit of how programming has
          changed from being its own career path, to now being something that
          you could learn and have that knowledge as a tool.

          No texts, but there were a few videos.
        </p>
        <p>
          This week's videos show us the miracles, and curses of social media.
          Although social media does have its upsides, like bringing us
          together. Good example of this would be this pandemic and social media
          being a safer way of communicating without risking the health of
          others in these dire times. While it does bring positives, there are
          also a chunk of negatives. It could drive one to be obsessive. The
          platforms need to have good security, so they aren't susceptible to
          cyberattacks. And social media systems need to be look over by
          moderators, basically they'd look at what would be posted, and
          evaluate whether or not it is allowed to be posted. Unfortunately, the
          moderators of big social media platforms have been traumatized by the
          workplace and its conditions, and the higher-ups weren't helpful, only
          desirable results were wanted. To conclude, social media is an
          innovation that need to be moderated and secured.

        <p>There were <b>three</b> texts to read:</p>
        <p>
          Firstly, the text is about emergence of web art. The Internet was also
          the great start to innumerous communities all over the globe without
          as much "marginalization" (Greene, 163). The artists, or .net-artists
          as they are called, work about by manipulating certain
          "characteristics" of the Internet (Greene, 162). Around the 90s was
          when "Web-Art" really started to go off with emerging .net-artists.
          This was the time where people were REALLY experimenting with HTML
          coding. Various people from different backgrounds have made very
          interesting pieces about their ideals. To conclude, this emergence
          demonstrates the curios and experimentations with a new way of making
          computer art.
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly, the text is about the cointed term, "Post-Internet Art"
          (Vierkant,3). This is a time where digital media is becoming
          "infinitely more malleable" and a "banality" (Vierkant, 3). We are at
          point with the Internet where everything is in flux, and there's is no
          true sense of "originality" (Vierkant, 4-5), I find this interesting
          because I've been told in class if I recall, that while it is very
          hard to be "original", you can do better by innovating upon it. Since
          there is so much similarities that might be found in today's media, we
          can do our best as a viewer by judging things based on what we are
          "aware" of (Vierkant, 10). To conclude, things are becoming more
          ambiguous on whether something is original, and we can make sure to
          all the medias possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lastly, the text is about the emergence of "cryptocurrency",
          "blockchains", and "crypto art/NFT". "Cryptocurrency" is a new type of
          online currency that has its own stock market, there are various
          different kinds of them too, like "Bitcoin", "Etherium", etc. They can
          used and traded in many ways. The text tends to focus on the pieces of
          art from crypto are called NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens), and a very nice
          upside is that artists have a new market to sell their artwork and
          profit from their work, where otherwise it is a rough field. While
          this occurence does help a group of people, they do unfortunately
          drain an exorbitant amount of electricity which is concerning, and we
          already have existing issues of "CO2 emissions" on our hands. And like
          other industries, there will be those who take advantage of it, and
          run a ponzie scheme and scam people (HM). To conclude about crypto, it
          is a promising market, but it's been having a rough time with some bad
          actors.
        </p>
        <p>
          We learned to put our JS and CSS code into external files, so all the
          code isn't all in one place.

        <p>There were <b>two</b> texts to read:</p>
        <p>
          Firstly, the text is a manifesto by "GNU", whom make points at how
          "free" software should be viewed as, while going into the issue of the
          computer industry and copyright. Their goal is a solid OS that is good
          and free like "air" (Stallman), while promoting good "free" values
          (Stallman). Programmers suffer under the ruling of the competitive
          industry and the privatization of coding. I've have been learning
          coding through the sharing of it from other programming, and it hurts
          to see this. I find it very odd that some places restrict the
          installations of certain programs, like schools, where learning is the
          priority, which is contradictive to its goal. As a programmer, I've
          seen how there is so many ways to code something in one way or
          another, and I'd find it grueling to go through the efforts of coding
          just to be set back to zero, just because it just so happens that
          something like exist under a company. To conclude, I find it
          interesting that there is an ongoing effort to "free" computing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly, the text is about some histroy and extents of the copyright
          system. While copyright is somewhat of a fickle thing, its creation
          was indeed to help creative minds, while now however it is different,
          and unfortunately greater powers in a given industry could exercise
          copyright laws more potently (Lessig, 19). But depending on a piracy
          situation at hand, it is up to the high powers to decide whether or
          not to pursue and sue, like the issue of "doujinshis", just how many
          lawyers will be exercised and the cost of them and will it even be
          worth it in the end (Lessig, 26-28). As we are learning, we are also
          creating work in a kind of "Walt-Disney" fashion, where we take work
          and infusing with our own culture and ideals (Lessig, 24). To
          conclude, copyright is its own can of beans, and the sliver linings is
          where we creators work between.
        </p>
        <p>
          We've learned to work with advanced font settings, setting up our page
          with a parallax, and do more advanced JS (like a game, but more just a
          little dice roller).

          This text talks about the past of programming and those involved. It
          goes into how there used to be gender dynamics back in the old days
          during "WW2". Women were usually recognized as the bigger programmers,
          but they usually stopped to have famillies, and that when men started
          taking over (Chun, 32-33). Programming used to be more complex, there
          would be the need to press different switches, but with time things
          became more simple with more "automatic systems" (Chun, 29-30). It
          excited me that it mentioned that insurgence of new programmers
          through the development of more efficient machines with "newer
          features" (Chun, 40), I guess you can say it includes us new kids. To
          conclude, I'd say that I'm happy to here to more history and people
          whom are part of this history, many people in family happen to have
          great jobs with computers.

          This text talks about many things on hackers, like how they are as
          people and on their sense of culture, and community. They are the type
          of people that are only comfortable with “machine things”, like
          computer with their inner working and malleability (Turkle, 184-185),
          and particularly others who share their same passion for “machine
          things” (Turkle, 198). Hackers tend to enjoy the idea of “winning”,
          and just doing that, and sometimes that idea is what could get them in
          trouble or a job (Turkle, 214). While I am unfamiliar of how hackers
          work their magic on security vulnerabilities, I find I can share their
          feelings towards their experience with coding and its lifestyle with
          my passion with gaming (Turkle, 186). I feel that I am very
          comfortable with games and sharing that passion with other gamers, and
          this extends to my work on becoming a game designer/developer.

          We learned to embed videos (.mp4 and .webm) and media content
          (Youtube, Twitter, Insta, etc), looked at validations to see what our
          page will be compatible with, and different orientations for systems
          with different resolutions.

          A little meme of a game I'm really liking as of recently (Cruelty
          Squad), this was found in a another Discord server I'm in. A video on
          a social plaform from a Youtuber that I like.

          This text is about the history of "Cloud" technology. The idea of the
          "cloud" has existed since 1922 (Hu, IX). As the "cloud" was being
          conceived, there is a lot of concern for this and it was said to be
          comparable to "nuclear war" (Hu, XII). It could be said that this fear
          of threat could be in relations to terrorism (Hu, XII). It talks about
          our insecurities and fantasies the cloud, how we "interact" with the
          online system on social media apps (Hu, XVII). There's the issue of
          "hacker" threats from other foreign countries trying to estabilish a
          power on the infrastructure (Hu, XVII). I find it interesting that
          there's the wrestling of power trying to grab hold of the "cloud".
          This reading was fun to read, it reminds one of the earlier readings,
          with the conception of the ARPANET, where there was relations with
          politics and military.
